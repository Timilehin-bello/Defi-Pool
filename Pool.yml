The procedures listed below can be used to construct the smart contracts for picking pools on Circle to generate interest rates based on APY (Annual Percentage Yield).

Choose a pool:

- Create a function that takes a list of pools that are available as input and outputs the pool with the highest APY.
- Use a method based on the pool's liquidity, trading costs, and other important considerations to iteratively go through the list of pools and get each one's APY.
- Track the pool with the highest APY by comparing the calculated APY for each pool.
- The pool with the greatest APY should be returned.

Structure Pool:
    liquidity: uint256
    tradingCosts: uint256
    Other relevant pool data can be added

Structure User:
    balance: uint256
    lastDistributionTimestamp: uint256

Variable chosenPool: Pool
Mapping users: address => User

Function pickPool(pools: Pool[]): public
    Require pools.length > 0, "No pools provided"

    Variable highestAPYPool: Pool
    Variable highestAPY: uint256

    For i in 0 to pools.length:
        Variable currentPool: Pool = pools[i]
        Variable currentAPY: uint256 = calculateAPY(currentPool)

        If currentAPY > highestAPY:
            highestAPY = currentAPY
            highestAPYPool = currentPool

    chosenPool = highestAPYPool
    Return chosenPool

Function calculateAPY(pool: Pool): internal returns (uint256)
    # Perform calculations to determine the APY for a given pool
    # You can use the provided liquidity, trading costs, and other factors here

    # Example calculation:
    # uint256 apy = (pool.liquidity * 100) / (pool.tradingCosts + 1)
    # return apy

    # Replace the example calculation with your own logic based on your requirements
    # and the available data for determining APY


Generate Interest:
- Users can put their money into the pool with the highest APY once it has been chosen to earn interest on their deposits.
- Create a function that enables users to contribute a certain number of tokens to the chosen pool.
- Transfer the user's deposited tokens to the smart contract from their wallet.
- Maintain the balance of the entire pool while updating the user's balance in the smart contract.


Function contributeTokens(amount: uint256): public
    Require chosenPool.liquidity > 0, "No pool chosen"

    Variable user: User = users[msg.sender]

    # Transfer tokens from user's wallet to the smart contract
    # Assuming ERC20 token transfer
    # Make sure to approve the contract to spend the tokens first
    # Token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount)

    distributeInterest(user)

    user.balance += amount
    chosenPool.liquidity += amount
    

Interest Distribution and Calculation:

- Create a function that computes interest and distributes it to users.
- Find out how long the money has been in the pool since the last interest distribution.
- Determine the interest that has accumulated using the APY and term of the pool.
- According to each user's deposited token balance, distribute the interest proportionally to them all.
- Update the distributed interest to the user's balance and the overall pool balance as necessary.


Function distributeInterest(user: User): internal
    If user.lastDistributionTimestamp == 0:
        user.lastDistributionTimestamp = block.timestamp
        Return

    Variable timeSinceLastDistribution: uint256 = block.timestamp - user.lastDistributionTimestamp
    If timeSinceLastDistribution == 0:
        Return

    Variable interest: uint256 = (chosenPool.liquidity * calculateAPY(chosenPool) * timeSinceLastDistribution) / (365 days * 100)
    Variable totalBalance: uint256 = chosenPool.liquidity + interest

    user.balance = (user.balance * totalBalance) / chosenPool.liquidity
    user.lastDistributionTimestamp = block.timestamp

    chosenPool.liquidity = totalBalance


Withdrawal:
- Users have the option of withdrawing both their initial deposits and any interest earned.
- Create a function that enables users to take a certain number of tokens out of the pool.
- Make that the user has enough money in their account to cover the withdrawal amount.
- Return the specified tokens to the user's wallet via the smart contract.
- Update both the user's and the pool's overall balances.


Function withdrawTokens(amount: uint256): public
    Require amount > 0, "Invalid withdrawal amount"

    Variable user: User = users[msg.sender]
    Require user.balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance"

    distributeInterest(user)

    user.balance -= amount
    chosenPool.liquidity -= amount

    # Transfer tokens back to user's wallet
    # Assuming ERC20 token transfer
    # Token.transfer(msg.sender, amount)
